# SKIN LESION CLASSIFICATION

This work aims to leverage deep learning network-based methods to extract features from skin cancer images from the HAM10000 dataset. By employing deep learning architectures, the study seeks to identify and highlight key features of the images, to use them in the classifier. The ultimate goal involves developing a dynamic selection framework to classify these images based on different skin cancer types.

## APPROACHES

Three different approaches will be proposed:

- Using neural networks as classifiers
- Using neural networks as feature extractors and classical machine learning and ensemble algorithms as classifiers
- Using neural networks as feature extractors and dynamic selection algorithms as classifiers

---

## CODE STRUCTURE

Each of the approaches mentioned has a README.md file within their respective folders, this is done to provide greater clarity in the explanations.



After all the tests are completed, a final results section will be created in this README.md, making it easier to view the best results obtained in this work.
